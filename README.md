# Project on Hold ðŸ˜•

Hey everyone,

Just a heads up: our project is currently on hold. Why, you ask? Well, seems like the Tomcat plugin we're counting on isn't playing nice with the latest Jakarta EE specs.

The deal is, the current plugin versions are a no-go for handling these specs, and it's causing us a bit of a headache.

We're in full troubleshooting mode, exploring different options. One of the ideas on the table is switching over to Spring Boot, which has a rep for playing nice with Jakarta EE specs.

Thanks for hanging tight and bearing with us while we sort this out. We'll keep you posted on our next moves.

Cheers for being part of this journey!

Best,
