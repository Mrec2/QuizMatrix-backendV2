## Issue Resolved! ðŸŽ‰

Hey everyone,

Great news! We've managed to solve the problem, and now the Maven version of the project is up and running smoothly.

As previously mentioned, we were facing compatibility issues with the Tomcat plugin and the latest Jakarta EE specs. However, after some thorough troubleshooting, we've found a solution that works.

We considered various options, and one of them involved transitioning to Spring Boot, known for its seamless integration with Jakarta EE specs. However, we were able to address the issue without resorting to this change.

We appreciate your patience and support throughout this process. Your understanding has been invaluable as we navigated through these challenges.

Thank you for being a part of this journey!

Best,
